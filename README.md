<h1>Netflix</h1>

The specifcation required the creation of a Netflix video content application that would support several specific 'Content Types' including 'Movie' (which I would be responsible for), 'Series' and 'Documentary'.

Each 'Content Type' would have shared instance variables and methods with all content as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type.

This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.

A driver class Netflix would also be required to facilite user searches - using parameterised methods.
